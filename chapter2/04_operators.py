# there are 4 types of operators in python
#namely: 'arithematic operators', 'assignment operators', ;comparison operators', 'logical operators'


# arithematic operator
a=43
b=33
c=a+b
print(c)


# assignment opertators
a=6+8 #assign 6+8 value in a variable
print(a)

b=6
# b+=3 #increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
b-=3 #decrement the value of b by 3 then assign it to b
print(b)


#comparison operator

d=5+6==11
print(d)


#logical operators
# there are three logical operators in python programming language
# namely 'and', 'or', 'not' 

e=False or True
print(e)

print(not(True)) # this will result in 'Flase' output
